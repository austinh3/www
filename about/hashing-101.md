## HISTORY:

Hashing started in 1937 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . It is based on the Old English Game, “HARES AND HOUNDS”. Hashers (Harriers and Harriettes) take turns being “HARES” and they decide where to set a trail. The “HARES” lay the trail using dollops of flour and the rest of the group, HOUNDS”, try to follow it. The idea is to keep the group together, so there are False Trails and Loops to slow down the faster runners. You can run a little or a lot, jog slow, or even walk the trail.

## WHAT TO EXPECT:

- __BEER!__
- Running and or walking about 3 TO 8 Miles through fields, streams, woods and even some streets
- Hash trail part will take about one and one half to 2 Hours
- About 30 to 40 of us will be there
- The Austin Hash is about 40% Female.

## WHAT TO BRING:

- Wear old running shoes
- Some dry clothes, socks and shoes and money for the ON ON ON
- Some Hashers like to carry and blow whistles (helps keep the group together)
- For first time virgin (i.e., have never hashed before), $5 for your first trail. Your second time is FREE!! Only $5 after that for members. Visiting hashers pay $5.
