# Want to Have Hounds Chasing You?
Haring a trail is the thing that binds us together as a kennel. Without mass participation in haring, we would not have trail every week. Or itâ€™d be a JM death march half the time. Hares create the weekly adventure we share together as hashers.

Before you hare at Austin H3, you should have several trails as a hound under your belt, with at least a few in our kennel. Haring is hard, but rewarding!

See the following information about haring at Austin H3:

* [Haring Expectations](about/haring-expectations.html)
* [Calendar of Austin Area Hashing Events](/calendar.html)
